\section*{Abstract}

Successful design and implementation of a complex system requires structure. This structure is most often provided by a systems engineering model or framework. The various models have their advantages and disadvantages, and are chosen accordingly to the type of project. FFI(Forsvarets Forskningsinstitutt) has requested a research paper on the benefits and drawbacks of variable pitch quadcopters. The paper shall provide an analysis of stability, efficiency and capabilities of variable pitch quadcopters for use in turbulent conditions. The paper will also discuss and investigate the design, dynamics and control theory of a variable pitch quadcopter.

Due to the nature of this project we've chosen Scrum with modifications. Our modifications to Scrum consists of extra time scheduling to ensure that deadlines are met, as well as extra documentation of the requirements (backlog items).

\newline
This paper will define Scrum, explain agile and explain how we intend to use and modify Scrum.
