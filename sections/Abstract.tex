\section{Abstract}

Successful design and implementation of a complex system requires structure. This structure is most often provided by a systems engineering model. There are various types of models with different advantages and disadvantages.The systems engineering model should be chosen accordingly to the project and its nature. \\\\
For our project we've chosen Scrum with modifications. Scrum is a iterative and incremental agile project development framework. Our modifications to scrum consists of extra time schedules to ensure meeting the deadline as well as extra documentation not specified in the scrum framework.
